# Arcade Game

Classic arcade game like frogger but now with bugs as enemies and a person as the player. The Player can use **the arrow keys UP RIGHT DOWN LEFT** to move the player around. Don't collide into an enemy! That will reset the game. Once you have reached the water you win and get + 1 point on your score and the player can try it again.
